### Breast Cancer Classification - ReadMe

#### Overview
This project involves the development of a breast cancer classification model using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this notebook is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, with various features derived from digitized images of breast mass, which help classify whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

#### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded and explored for structure, missing values, and feature distributions.
   - Features are examined to understand their relationship with the target variable (`diagnosis`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Unnecessary columns are removed.
   - Label encoding is applied to the `diagnosis` column, converting labels to numeric format (0 for benign, 1 for malignant).
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization techniques, such as histograms and violin plots, are used to analyze the distribution of key features, and their relationship with tumor classification.
   - Correlation matrices and heatmaps are generated to investigate relationships between various features.

4. **Modeling**:
   - The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
   - `RandomForestClassifier` is chosen as the primary model for feature selection and training.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize model parameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
   - The tuned Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of approximately 93.75% on the validation set.
   - Visualizations, such as heatmaps for the confusion matrix, are used to assess the modelâ€™s predictions.
